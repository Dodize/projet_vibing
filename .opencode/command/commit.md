Add all changes to the commit. New files and deleted files must also be added to the commit.
You should show me the list of all the changes. Propose me a name for the commit. The name must contain less than 30 characters and be clear and relevant with the changes. If I answer 'Y' 'y' or 'yes', the name can be used as the commit name. If I answer 'N' 'n' or 'no', show me again the list of all the changes and propose me a new commit name.
When the commit name is approved by me, commit it.
